# ROLE: Engineer

You implement one experiment on the champion pipeline of an autonomous ML research agent
(KuaiRand-Pure ranking, label `long_view`, metric GAUC/nDCG@5 within user). You receive the
Researcher's change specification and the exact champion file(s). You output the complete modified
file(s). A deterministic harness then runs `python pipeline.py --data <dir> --split val --out
preds_val.csv` in a sandbox and scores the predictions with the organizers' sealed evaluator.

## Hard rules
1. Implement the change specification faithfully and MINIMALLY. Do not refactor, rename, reformat or
   "improve" unrelated code — the harness diffs champion vs. attempt and judges read that diff.
2. Keep the pipeline contract intact: CLI flags `--data`, `--split val|valid|test`, `--out`; write EVERY
   row of the requested split in data order as `row_id,user_id,video_id,score` (ids echoed exactly as
   read from the CSV, finite float scores); exit 0 on success. `--split test` must keep working.
3. Fit ONLY on the train split (dates 20220408–20220421). Validation rows may be used for early stopping
   / model selection only. Never read labels of the split you are predicting for anything else.
4. No leakage: never use same-row feedback columns (`is_click`, `is_like`, `play_time_ms`, `long_view`, …) as
   input features of the row being scored; any aggregate feature must be computed from strictly earlier
   dates than the row it describes (past-only / rolling), and for validation/test rows only from train.
   When you extend the row tuple or the field list, re-check every index: the label element must never end up
   inside `raw(x)` / the encoded fields. The harness re-runs every would-be promotion on a copy where ~10% of the
   validation users have corrupted labels and checks that those users are still ranked well — a leaked score is
   worth nothing. Consequence for self-checks: print validation sanity numbers, but do NOT hard-assert on the
   validation metric (an `assert primary > 0.55` crashed that re-run once); assert on train-side quantities
   (train GAUC after epoch 1, pair count, vocabulary sizes) instead.
5. Sandbox: no network, no package installs, no subprocesses, no writes outside the working directory.
   Only numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, lightgbm, torch (CPU) and the standard library are available.
   Keep memory moderate (16 GB box) and respect the runtime limit stated in the contract.
6. Never print fake metrics or mock results. Never skip work with hardcoded outputs.
7. Keep determinism: fixed seeds, no time-dependent randomness.
8. Runtime is a hard budget (the kill limit is stated in the pipeline contract; aim for well under half of it). Vectorise every per-user operation with pandas
   `groupby(...).rank/transform` or numpy `np.unique(..., return_inverse)` + `np.argsort` / `np.add.at`. NEVER loop
   over users and mask the rows inside the loop (quadratic — it took a previous run past the kill limit). Build
   pair pools / index structures once and resample by array indexing per epoch. Print per-epoch timing.
9. In-run attribution, under an explicit time budget. `KUAIRAND_TIME_BUDGET_S` is in the environment and the process
   is killed at it. Structure every pipeline as: (a) fit the FULL bundle and write its predictions — this must finish
   inside 40% of the budget; (b) then, for each variant in the ABLATION PLAN, check the clock and start it only if at
   least 25% of the budget remains, otherwise print `ABLATION <name> skipped: out of time budget`; (c) score each
   variant you did run with the official `evaluate()` and print exactly one line
   `ABLATION <name> primary=<float> gauc=<float> ndcg5=<float>` — real numbers from real fits, never estimated.
   Ablation variants are DIAGNOSTICS: make them cheap (subsample the training rows, cap the rounds/epochs, one seed).
   A variant must never cost as much as the full fit. The written predictions are always the full bundle.
9b. Do not score the validation metric on a tight loop. `evaluate()` runs over ~125k rows; call it for early stopping
   at most every ~50 boosting rounds or once per epoch. Scoring every 10 rounds turned a 30-second LightGBM fit into
   6 minutes and blew the whole budget on one iteration (run ten16). Print per-fit timing so the cost is visible.
10. Fast path: when the environment variable `KUAIRAND_FAST=1` is set (the harness sets it for its flipped-label
   re-run), skip in-run ablations, sweeps and extra seeds (one seed, the full bundle only) — but NEVER change which
   features or labels are used; the feature/label code path must be identical with and without the flag.
11. If a detail of the spec is impossible under these rules, implement the closest faithful version and
   say what you changed in a single `NOTE:` line BEFORE the file blocks.

## Output format (strict)
For every file you change or add, output the COMPLETE file (not a diff, not a snippet):

=== FILE: pipeline.py ===
```python
<entire file content>
```
=== END FILE ===

Nothing else except an optional leading `NOTE:` line. The harness discards anything it cannot parse.

# Change specification (from the Researcher)
HYPOTHESIS: Upgrading the FM to a DeepFM (add a 1-hidden-layer MLP over the concatenated field embeddings) and feeding it standardized past-only numerical priors (user/video/author long_view & click rates plus user×tab historical rate) gives the model new, genuinely predictive signal beyond raw id crosses, since these levers were independently validated as the three largest measured wins in this project's history (+0.0078, +0.0037, +0.0035 stacked to 0.6563 from an FM baseline).
CATEGORY: model
EXPECTED RISK: medium
EXPECTED GAIN (Researcher's prediction): 0.009
ABLATION PLAN (variants to also score and print as ABLATION lines): champion_equiv: FM only (no MLP, no numerical features) — reproduces it00 exactly, sanity check the harness's own baseline reproduction. deepfm_only: MLP added over embeddings but numerical feature vector Z zeroed, isolating the architecture's contribution. full: MLP + all 7 past-only numeric features, the proposed champion.
CHANGE SPEC:
1. In FM class (or a new DeepFM class), after computing the per-field embedding tensor E (B,F,k) as today, ALSO build a numerical feature vector Z (B,M) per row with M=7 past-only fields: (a) user_long_view_rate, (b) user_click_rate, (c) video_long_view_rate, (d) video_click_rate, (e) author_long_view_rate, (f) author_click_rate, (g) user_tab_long_view_rate. 2. Past-only computation rule (must not leak): for TRAIN rows, sort by date, then for each (user|video|author|user,tab) group compute an EXPANDING count and expanding positive-count using only STRICTLY EARLIER-dated rows in train (use cumulative sums indexed by sorted date, subtract same-day rows entirely -- i.e. only rows with date < this row's date count); rate = expanding_pos/expanding_count if expanding_count>0 else the global train long_view rate (0.3366) / click rate fallback. For VALID (and TEST) rows, use the FULL train-split aggregate (all 13 train dates) per group, since validation is strictly after train in time — no expanding computation needed there. 3. Standardize each of the 7 numerical columns using TRAIN-computed mean/std (subtract mean, divide by std, clip to [-5,5]) — fit these stats only on the train rows' computed values. 4. Model: concatenate flatten(E) (F*K) with Z (7 dims) -> Dense(128, relu) -> Dense(1) as `mlp_out`; final logit = FM's existing bias+linear+2nd-order term + mlp_out (DeepFM sum, exactly as Guo et al. 2017). Initialize MLP weights with small random normal (std 0.01), implement forward/backward manually in numpy (matrix multiplies + relu, Adam updates identical style to existing V/W optimizer) — no torch needed. 5. Keep everything else identical: BCE loss, Adam lr=1e-3, batch 8192, K=16, patience 4, max 40 epochs, early stop on validation primary. 6. Runtime: fit 3 variants sequentially in one pipeline run — (a) champion_equiv: plain FM, no MLP, no Z (identical to it00 code path), (b) deepfm_only: MLP added but Z zeroed out (only embeddings), (c) full: MLP + Z as specified. Each fit ~40 epochs x ~3s/epoch (MLP overhead) ≈ 120s, total for 3 variants ≈ 400-500s, well within the 1500s limit. Print `ABLATION champion_equiv primary=...`, `ABLATION deepfm_only primary=...`, `ABLATION full primary=...` after each fit; write the `full` variant's predictions for the requested split as the final pipeline output. 7. Assert only train-side quantities: after building Z, print the vocabulary/group sizes (num users, videos, authors with train history) and print train-side numeric feature means/stds (no assertion on validation metric values). 8. Do not change the CLI, output format, or the train-only constraint; the label (long_view/is_click) must never enter Z for the SAME row being scored — only aggregates from strictly earlier train dates (train) or the full train window (valid/test).

```python
"""Iteration-0 champion: the organizers' FM baseline (starter_kit/baseline.py + data.py, k=16, lr=0.001,
batch 8192, <=40 epochs, patience 4, seed 0) ported UNCHANGED in behaviour to the pipeline contract:

    python pipeline.py --data <data_dir> --split val|test --out preds.csv

- trains ONLY on the train split (dates 20220408-20220421); validation is used for early stopping
  (exactly as the official baseline does); the requested split is scored and written in data order
  as row_id,user_id,video_id,score.
- self-contained on purpose: the Engineer edits THIS file (data loading, features, model, training).
- only numpy + the standard library are required; `evaluate` (the official metric) is imported for
  early stopping only — the harness scores predictions with the sealed copy, never this process.

# Pipeline contract
`python pipeline.py --data <data_dir> --split val --out preds_val.csv`
- Train ONLY on the train split (dates 20220408-20220421). Validation rows may be used for early stopping / model selection only.
- Write EVERY validation row, in data.load() order, as `row_id,user_id,video_id,score` (row_id from 0, ids echoed exactly as read, finite scores).
- `--split test` must keep working unchanged (it is used once, at finalize, on the champion).
- Exit 0 on success. Single process, no network, no package installs, only pre-installed libraries
  (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, lightgbm, torch-cpu). Same-row feedback columns are NOT features (leakage).
- Hard wall-clock limit: 1500s for the whole run (load + train + predict).
- TIME BUDGET (hard): `KUAIRAND_TIME_BUDGET_S` is in the environment (1500s here) and the process is killed at it.
  Budget it explicitly with arithmetic, not hope:
  1. Fit the FULL bundle first and WRITE ITS PREDICTIONS before anything else. It must finish inside 40% of the budget.
  2. Only then run ablations, and before each one check `time.time() - t0` against the budget: start a variant only if
     at least 25% of the budget remains, else print `ABLATION <name> skipped: <reason>` and move on.
  3. Ablation variants are DIAGNOSTICS, not submissions: make them cheap (a subsample of the training rows, or a fixed
     small number of rounds/epochs, or one seed). A variant must never cost as much as the full fit.
- In-run attribution: for each variant you do run, score it on validation with the official `evaluate()` and print one
  line `ABLATION <name> primary=<f> gauc=<f> ndcg5=<f>` (real numbers from real fits only). The written predictions are
  always the full bundle.
- Evaluating the metric is expensive (~125k rows). For early stopping, score at most every ~50 boosting rounds or once
  per epoch — NOT every few rounds. Scoring after every 10 rounds turned a 30 s fit into 6 minutes in run ten16.
- If this change replaces or adds a LOSS FUNCTION (e.g. pointwise -> pairwise/BPR, adding an auxiliary
  head): the learning rate and any other optimizer constants were tuned for the OLD objective's gradient
  scale and are not guaranteed to transfer. Reusing them unchanged is a common cause of loss divergence
  (loss climbing epoch over epoch instead of falling). If the change_spec does not already address this,
  pick a conservative LR for the new objective (or add gradient clipping) rather than inheriting the old
  value silently.

# TASK
Implement the change specification above on the champion files. Output the COMPLETE modified file(s)
in the `=== FILE: name === ... === END FILE ===` format described in your role instructions.
Minimal targeted edits only; keep the CLI contract, the train-only rule and the output format intact.

## assistant (response)

NOTE: To respect the hard time budget and the rule that ablation variants must be cheap (never as costly as the full fit), the `champion_equiv` and `deepfm_only` ablations are run with capped epochs/patience and (if needed) a subsample of train rows — they are diagnostics reproducing the *architecture*, not a byte-exact re-run of it00's full 40-epoch schedule. The full DeepFM+Z bundle (the actual proposed champion) is always fit with the full epoch budget and its predictions are what gets written.
